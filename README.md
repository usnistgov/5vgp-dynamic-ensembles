## README

This is the README file for the data conatined in 5vgp-dynamic-ensembles/

Per the [GitHub ROB][gh-rob] and [NIST Suborder 1801.02][nist-s-1801-02],
this README contains:

1. Software or Data description
   - Statements of purpose and maturity: This dataset contains the three best fitting dynamic ensemble models derived from fitting SWAXS and DEER experimental data collected on the Fc domain of NISTmAb. Each dynamic ensemble contains 20 overlapping CH2 domains. The data is described in the publication, "Structure and Dynamics of Monoclonal Antibody Domains Using Spins, Scattering, and Simulations" 
   - Description of the repository contents: Three PDB files, each containing 20 models of overlapping CH2 domains.
   - Technical installation instructions, including operating
     system or software dependencies: There are no technical installation instructions - PDBs can be used as-is.
